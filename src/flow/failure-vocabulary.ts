/**
 * The fixed vocabulary of reasons this flow is willing to persist.
 *
 * WHY A VOCABULARY AT ALL. A failure reason travels further than it looks. It is recorded on the
 * lifecycle, it can be carried into the chain observation, and the chain observation is covered by
 * a digest inside a signed record. Anything that reaches it is therefore signed, published, and
 * permanent. The values available at those points come from a remote facilitator or from an
 * exception message, and neither is bounded, structured, or under this example's control: a
 * response body, a stack trace, an endpoint URL with a token in it, or several kilobytes of
 * whatever a server felt like returning would all arrive by the same path.
 *
 * So nothing is copied. Every reason persisted anywhere is one of the terms declared here.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF TERM. The generic terms are decisions this flow makes about what it observed:
 * verification refused, verification raised, settlement refused, settlement raised, handler failed.
 * The upstream terms are machine codes this integration deliberately supports, and one of those
 * survives verbatim only if it is both shaped like a machine code and named in the allowlist. A
 * string that satisfies only the shape is still not adopted: a well-formed code nobody declared is
 * exactly how an unbounded value would slip in wearing a disguise.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a redaction of the observed x402 field values. Those are captured
 * wire artifacts, bound by digest, and they carry whatever the facilitator actually sent, because
 * that is the thing the evidence exists to record. This is about the reasons this flow derives and
 * writes down in its own words.
