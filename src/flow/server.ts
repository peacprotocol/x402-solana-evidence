/**
 * The paid resource: one express endpoint behind the x402 payment middleware.
 *
 * OBSERVATION. The lifecycle is observed through the upstream hooks. `onProtectedRequest` sees the
 * request before payment processing and carries the payment field value the middleware itself
 * read; `onAfterVerify`, `onBeforeSettle`, `onAfterSettle`, `onSettleFailure`, `onVerifyFailure`
 * and `onVerifiedPaymentCanceled` report each lifecycle transition with its result. Nothing here
 * wraps, replaces or re-implements the middleware in order to watch it.
 *
 * Two facts are not exposed by any hook, and only those two are taken from the application
 * boundary instead. The field values the middleware emits on the response, `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` and
 * `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, are read once the response has finished, through the ordinary express
 * response API, because the hooks report decoded objects while evidence binds the value that was
 * actually observed. And that a write was attempted at all is a property of the response rather
 * than of the payment, so it comes from the response `finish` event.
 *
 * The hooks are registered on a shared server instance but report per-request facts, so the
 * recorder for the request in flight is carried in asynchronous context rather than in a variable
 * that a second concurrent request would overwrite.
 *
 * STREAMING IS OUT OF SCOPE. The middleware buffers the handler's output so settlement can run
 * before the client sees anything, which is exactly what makes the "resource produced, payment not
 * settled" state observable. A streaming handler defeats that, so this reference flow serves one
 * buffered response and says so rather than appearing to support both.
