/**
 * Record-issuing keys for the two run modes.
 *
 * The offline path uses a fixed key so a repeated run produces identical bytes. That key is
 * written here in the source, in the open, because it is test material: it protects nothing, it is
 * published in a public repository, and treating it as a secret would be theatre. It is refused
 * outside the fixture mode so it cannot be reached by accident on a live run.
 *
 * The devnet path generates a key into a gitignored directory with owner-only permissions and
 * keeps it across runs, so the same issuer can be recognised between runs. It is a demonstration
 * key on a test network, not an organizational identity.
 *
 * WHAT THE KEY FILE BINDS. The issuer a record claims is not a free-standing configuration value:
 * it is the identity a key has been signing under. A key file that stored only the key would let
 * one key and one key identifier claim `https://a.example` on Monday and `https://b.example` on
 * Tuesday, purely because an environment variable changed, and both records would verify under the
 * same public key. A reader holding the two would have no way to tell which claim the key holder
 * meant, and this example would have demonstrated exactly the ambiguity it exists to avoid.
 *
 * So the issuer is written into the key file when the key is created, and every later run must be
 * configured for that same issuer. A disagreement stops the run and changes nothing on disk: the
 * two ways out are to configure the issuer the key already claims, or to set the key aside so a new
 * one is created for the new issuer. Neither is guessed at here, because both are decisions about
 * what an identity means, and only the person running it can make them.
 *
 * WHAT VERIFICATION MEANS HERE. A record that verifies against one of these keys shows that its
 * contents are intact relative to the key material supplied to the verifier. It does not show that
 * the key belongs to any particular organization, and nothing in this example establishes that.
 *
 * HOW THE KEY IS CREATED. Through the published surface of the protocol's own crypto package:
 * `generateKeypair` produces the 32-byte private key and its public key, and `derivePublicKey`
 * recomputes the public key from the private one on reload, so the stored file never has to be
 * trusted for anything but the private half. Nothing here reaches past those functions into
 * internals, and no key bytes are assembled by hand.
