/**
 * One PEAC record per run, and the evidence directory around it.
 *
 * ONE RECORD, NOT A BUNDLE. The record carries digests; the documents those digests cover sit
 * beside it as ordinary files. No archive format, manifest or container is invented here: a
 * directory of files and a signed record that names them by digest is enough, and anything more
 * would be a format this example is in no position to define.
 *
 * WHAT GOES WHERE. The registered commerce group carries the registered payment fields and nothing
 * else, because it validates strictly and rejects unknown keys, which is what makes it a shared
 * vocabulary rather than a bag. Everything observational lives in an example-local group whose key
 * is namespaced to this example, so it cannot be mistaken for a registered PEAC field.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Issuance stamps an issued-at time from the process clock and there is no option to
 * supply one, so the offline path pins the clock for the duration of the call. That is the whole
 * of the determinism arrangement: the record identifier is supplied, every other input is fixed,
 * and no part of the issuance path is patched or reimplemented.
