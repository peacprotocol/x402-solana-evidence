/**
 * Show what tampering looks like from outside.
 *
 * The committed evidence is copied to a temporary directory, exactly one bound field is changed to
 * a more flattering value, and the same verifier that passes on the untouched directory is run
 * against the copy. The committed evidence is never modified.
 *
 * The interesting part is not that verification fails. It is that the failure names the document
 * that was edited, so a reader learns which claim is not supported rather than being told the
 * whole directory is suspect.
 *
 * Exits non-zero if verification fails to notice, because a tamper demonstration that quietly
 * passes is worse than none.
